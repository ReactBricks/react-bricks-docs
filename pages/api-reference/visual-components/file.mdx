# File

**The File component allows the content creators to upload files.** This is useful when you need to have documents in your page that users can download. You can decide which file extensions are allowed.

**On the frontend you provide a render function** to render the file on the page (the argument is a file object with file name, url and file size).

**On the Admin interface content creators can upload a file** clicking on the component. It's also possible to change the file, remove it and provide a friendly name.

## Properties

Here's the Typescript interface for the props of the `File` component:

```ts
interface FileProps {
  propName: string
  renderBlock: (props: types.IFileSource) => JSX.Element
  allowedExtensions?: string[]
}

interface IFileSource {
  name: string // file name
  url: string
  size: number // in bytes
}
```
