# Plain

Plain text serializer / deserializer for a (Rich)Text value.

It has the `deserialize` method to convert a `string` into an editor value and the `serialize` method which does the opposite.

It is exported for compatibility and convenience, but there should be no use case for a user to directly call this two methods.
