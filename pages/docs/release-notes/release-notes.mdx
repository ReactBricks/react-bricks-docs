- Support for **compound components**
- **Dark mode support** to test content in dark mode

- **ALT Tag** for Images inside the upload menu
- **Better colors management**
- **Author** on page
- **Featured Image** on Page for Open graph tags
- **New Site and Blog starters** with great Tailwind bricks created for you
