# React Bricks v2

In January 2021, after almost a year since the first release, we are proud to release React Bricks v2.  
**There are many new features**, improvements and some small breaking change.

Here's a short list of things that changed:

- A React Brick now is a **React component** with a schema prop (not an object)
- **New Repeater component** to have multiple nested blocks inside a block
- Support for **compound components**
- **Dark mode support** to test content in dark mode
- **Collapsible Groups** for Side edit props
- **Big UX improvements** (more space for content, responsive preview, page/block/item tabs, collapsible groups)
- **ALT Tag** for Images inside the upload menu
- **Better colors management**
- **Author** on page
- **Featured Image** on Page for Open graph tags
- **New Site and Blog starters** with great Tailwind bricks created for you
- **Code preview** in Playground
- **Update** of all dependencies, code refactoring
- **New hooks** to create your visual editing components or access page meta values
