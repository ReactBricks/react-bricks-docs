# Repeated Bricks

A brick used as a repeater item is just a normal brick, but it must spread `...rest` props on its root element in order to be correctly focusable in the Admin interface.

## Example

```tsx highlight=5
const Badge: types.Brick<BadgeProps> = ({
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <div {...rest}>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}

Badge.schema = {
  ...
}

export default Badge
```

A repeated bricks receives also the `index` on the props, so that it may conditionally render based on its position in the items array.
