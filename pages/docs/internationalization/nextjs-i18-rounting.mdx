# Next.js i18n routing

Next.js has built in internationalization routing.

React Bricks starters with Next.js are already configure to leverage the i18n routing.

You just need to add languages to the languages array in `next.config.json`:

```json highlight=3
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en'], // Add your languages here
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    localeDetection: false,
  },
}
```
