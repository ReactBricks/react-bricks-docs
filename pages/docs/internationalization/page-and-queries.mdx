# Internationalization: Page and Queries

## Page and Translations

A `Page` that you get from the query hooks (`usePagesPublic`, `usePagePublic`) or the fetch helper functions (`fetchPages`, `fetchPage`) has a `translations` field with an array of available translations for that page.

Each translation has a `language` ('en', 'it', ...) and a `slug` (the slug for the page in that language).

### Page

```ts highlight=3
type Page = {
  ...
  translations: Translation[]
}
```

### Translation

```ts
type Translation = {
  language: string
  slug: string
}
```

## Queries

### usePagesPublic

The `usePagesPublic` hook has a `language` argument to return the published pages in the desired language.

See [usePagePublic](/api-reference/hooks/use-pages-public)

### fetchPages

The `fetchPages` helper function has the ability to specify a `language` in the `options` object.

See [fetchPages](/api-reference/utilities/fetch-pages)

### usePagePublic

The `usePagePublic` hook has arguments `slug` and `language`, so that you can specify the translation that you want to receive for that page, if more than one have the same slug.

See [usePagePublic](/api-reference/hooks/use-page-public)

### fetchPage

The `fetchPage` helper function has arguments `slug`, `apiKey`, `language`, so that you can specify the translation that you want to receive for that page, if more than one have the same slug.

See [fetchPage](/api-reference/utilities/fetch-page)
