# App Settings

Here the Admin user can set the App name, the languages for internationalization, the Deploy settings (staging and production build hooks).

A user with Editor role sees only the "Deploy" button to trigger a rebuild.

The App settings can also be set in the [React Bricks Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/react-bricks-dashboard)
