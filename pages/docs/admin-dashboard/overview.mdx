# Admin Dashboard

In the Starter projects, the Admin dashboard is available at the `/admin` path.  
It is already created for you, using React Bricks' `<Admin>`, `<Login>`, `<Editor>`,`<Playground>` and `<AppSettings>` components. See Admin components...

The Admin Dashboard has 3 views:

- [**The Editor**](editor): this is the main view where pages are created and content is edited.
- [**The Playground**](playground): this is where you can preview all the [Bricks](/docs/bricks/what-is-a-brick) and the [Page Types](/docs/configuration/page-types)
- [**App Settings / Deploy**](app-settings): here the Editor can trigger a rebuild of the static website (if hosted on Netlify or Vercel). The Admin may configure the App settings and invite Users.
