# Image

On the frontend, the `Image` component shows a responsive optimized image with progressive loading (lazy load).

On the Admin, it allows to **upload a new image**, opening a modal that allows you to set the alternate text (ALT) and SEO-friendly name (for the image URL). 

In order to boost performance and SEO, upon upload, React Bricks will:

- **Create responsive optimized images**
- **Create the srcSet** to be used on the frontend for the optimal image selection
- Create a **light blurred placeholder** for the progressive loading
- Save them on a **global CDN**
- Enforce the **SEO-friendly name** via proper rewrite rules



## Properties

Here's the Typescript interface for the props of the `Image` component:

```ts
interface ImageProps {
  propName: string
  alt: string
  maxWidth?: number
  noLazyLoad?: boolean
  containerClassName?: string
  containerStyle?: object
  imageClassName?: string
  imageStyle?: object
}
```

## Properties definition

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `propName` | The prop of the Brick component corresponding to this image. |
| `alt` | The fallback alternate text for the image when it isn't provided via the upload modal |
| `maxWidth` | This is the maximum width in pixel at which your image will be displayed. It is used to calculate the responsive images for normal and retina displays.<br />The default value is 800. |
| `noLazyLoad` | Set to `true` to avoid the lazy load behaviour. Default is `false`. |
| `containerClassName` | Optional className to apply to the image container (a thin wrapper created by React Bricks). |
| `imageClassName` | Optional className to apply to the `<img>` tag. |
| `imageStyle` | Optional style object to apply to the `<img>` tag. |

## Usage example

```jsx
  <Image propName="image" alt="Product" maxWidth="420" />
```
