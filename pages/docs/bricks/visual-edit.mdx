# Intro to Visual editing

In your Brick components you can use React Bricks exported Visual editing components.

## Text

**Used to have an editable plain text.**

See the [Text docs](/api-reference/visual-components/text)

## RichText

**Used for multiline rich text editing.**
You may choose the available rich text features (bold, italic, link, code, highlight, headings, quote) and provide custom render functions for each feature.

See the [RichText docs](/api-reference/visual-components/rich-text)

## RichTextExt

This is the new **extensible version of the `RichText` component**. It is based on a plugins system, which allows you to customize also the buttons, the shortcut hot keys and create custom plugins from scratch.

See the [RichTextExt docs](/api-reference/visual-components/rich-text-ext).

To extend the RichText behavior, you may see also plugin helpers like [markPluginConstructor](/api-reference/utilities/mark-plugin-constructor) and [blockPluginConstructor](/api-reference/utilities/block-plugin-constructor).

## Image

The Image component allows to **show and upload images**. React Bricks APIs will create a small size placeholder for lazy loading and responsive versions to **optimize** data transfer. Images are served from a **global CDN**.
On the frontend, this component lazyloads the images and uses the sourceSet created on the server to load the optimal image size.

See the [Image docs](/api-reference/visual-components/image)

## File

The File component **allows the user to upload files**. This is useful when you need to have **downloadable documents** in your page.
You can provide a render function to present the document on the frontend (the argument is a file object with file name, url and file size). On the Admin interface you'll be able to click on the component and upload a file, change it, remove it and provide a friendly name for it.

See the [File docs](/api-reference/visual-components/file)
