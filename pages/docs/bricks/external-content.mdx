# External content

## Why use external content in React Bricks?

React Bricks is a great authoring tool for your content creators, but sometimes:

1. **You need structured content** (entities with relationships) to reuse across pages. Headless CMSs solve this problem very well.
2. **You have existing content** in your headless CMS that serves as a single source of truth.
3. **You have an e-commerce** (for example on Shopify) and you need to get data from the e-commerce inside of React Bricks bricks. React Bricks is great for editing product landing pages.

## How to get external content

### 1. Get external data

On each `pageType`, you can define your `getExternalData` function.

**It takes a [Page](/api-reference/types/types#page) as argument** (so that you have access to the slug, or any custom fields) and it must **return a Promise that resolves to an object**. That object will be put on the page, in `externalData`.

You can then access external data:

- using the `usePageValues` hook (if you just need to render external data as it is);
- using the `mapExternalDataToProps`, in order to be able to override this data via visual editing: see the next paragraph.

> See also [pageType](/docs/configuration/page-types)

### 2. Map external data to the bricks' props

The simpler way to use external content is using the `mapExternalDataToProps` on your bricks' `schema`. **Each brick can map the external data to its props.**

The `mapExternalDataToProps` function has 2 arguments:

1. **External data**
2. **Brick's props**

You **return an object with the new props** you want on your content block.

> See also [brick's schema](/docs/bricks/schema)

## Examples

### 1. Read only

If you just want to render a product title from an e-commerce, you can do this:

```ts
mapExternalDataToProps: (externalData, bricksProps) => ({
  title: externalData.title,
})
```

Now you can just render `{title}` in your JSX.

### Visually override external content

If you want to be able to replace the title from the e-commerce data source, you can do this:

```ts
import { Plain } from 'react-bricks/frontend'

mapExternalDataToProps: (externalData, bricksProps) => ({
  title:
    bricksProps.title && Plain.serialize(bricksProps.title)
      ? bricksProps.title
      : externalData.title,
})
```

In this case, in your JSX, you can have a Text component from React Bricks, like this:

```tsx
<Text propName="title" />
```

If you change the title, you will save your version (for example a title best suited for a marketing landing page). As soon as you delete the title you are back from the official title from your "source of truth".

> ### Pass pageTypes to the fetchPage function
>
> If you come from a starter before v3.1 came out, you need to pass the `pageTypes` from React Bricks configuration to the `fetchPage` function. That's because fetchPage cannot access the ReactBricks context (being outside of the React context), but it needs pageTypes to call your `getExternalData` function after fetching the page.
