# How to deploy

## Static site generation

All the [Starter projects](/docs/getting-started/starter-projects) (either with [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)) are configured to use Static Site Generation.
At build time our APIs are called and the content is used to generate a static site that you can **deploy on any static hosting service** or **CDN**.

A static website is [great for many reasons](https://dev.to/matfrana/server-side-rendering-vs-static-site-generation-17nf), but **all the pages need to be rebuilt** when the content is updated.

### Rebuild as code changes

Providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which connect to your Github or Bitbucket repo, are able to trigger a rebuild every time you push a change to the repo. But this still doesn't help when it's the CMS content that changes.

### Rebuild as content changes

Luckily with many providers you can create a **Build hook, which is a URL** that, when called (usually in HTTP POST), **triggers a site rebuild**.

ReactBricks let the Admin set up a deploy hook URL for an App (from the AppSettings page of from React Bricks Dashboard), so that the Editor may just **click a "Deploy" button** to trigger a site rebuild and have the content updated.

## Server side rendering

In case of Server-side rendering, no hook needs to be called, as pages are generated at run-time.
