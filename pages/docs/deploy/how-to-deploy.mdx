# How to deploy

## Hosting requirements

**You can host a React Bricks website almost anywhere.**  
The starter projects with Next.js or Gatsby are configured to use **Static Site Generation**, so that you just need an hosting environment which is able to **build the website and serve the generated static content**, for example [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
If you want to use **Server side rendering**, you need to have an hosting environment that can generate the pages at runtime, running Node.js.

## Environment variables

An important thing to keep in mind is that **React Bricks needs 2 environment variables** that locally you have in your `.env` file and must be set in the hosting provider environment variables:

- `APP_ID`: this variable must be **accessible by the browser** and is used by the Admin interface
- `API_KEY`: this is the secret API_KEY which should not be exposed to the browser

In order to expose the APP_ID variable to the browser, for Next.js you need to call it `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID` and for Gatsby you need to call it `GATBSY_APP_ID`.

## Build hooks

Providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which connect to your Github or Bitbucket repo, are able to trigger a rebuild every time you push a change to the repo. But this doesn't help when it's the CMS content that changes.

Usually providers let you create a **Build hook, which is a URL** that, when called (usually in HTTP POST), **triggers a site rebuild**.

**ReactBricks lets the Admin set up 2 deploy hooks** for an App (one for the **Production** environment and one for the **Staging** environment).  
They can be set from the App Settings page of the Admin or from the React Bricks Dashboard.

The Admin can then give to the Editors the permission to trigger a Staging and/or Production deploy, simply clicking on **Deploy to Staging** or **Deploy to Production** from the Admin interface.
