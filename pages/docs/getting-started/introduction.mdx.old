# Introduction

React Bricks is:

1. **A React toolkit** to build a "Wix-like" visual CMS.
2. **A Backend as a service** where the content is persisted and images are optimized and served from a global CDN

## Why we built React Bricks

### For Content creators

We think that **headless CMSs are great for Developers, but not for Content creators.**

Content creators are put in front of **data-entry-like gray forms**, which are of very little inspiration.  
**We are making content editing fun, again.**

### For Developers

The existing tools with great content editing UX, like **Wix or Wordpress with Gutenberg blocks, are not great for front-end developers**.

With React Bricks **the content "lego bricks" are just React components** for a super-duper development experience.

The website or blog is a **blazing fast Next.js or Gatsby static site** with an `/admin` folder, that you can host wherever you want, for example on **Netlify or Vercel**.

## Why choose React Bricks

With React Bricks you work with the technology you love, with a modern and unique approach:

- **Visual editing**: the content you see in the Admin dashboard is the same published on your website.
- **Framework independent**: you may use [Gatsby](https://www.gastsbyjs.com), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) or just [React](https://reactjs.org).
- **Styling independent**: you may use any CSS framwork you like.
- **Hosting independent**: host the resulting static site where you like.
- **Optimized images**: cross-platform image optimization and hosting on a fast global CDN
